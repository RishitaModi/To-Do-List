# To-Do-List
This repository contains the code for a simple yet powerful to-do list application. The app is designed to help users keep track of their daily tasks, set priorities, and manage their time efficiently.

Creating a simple to-do list app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript involves several steps. Here is a step-by-step guide to help you through the process:

1. Set Up Your Project
Create a new folder for your project and inside it, create three files:

index.html
styles.css
script.js

2. HTML Structure
Open index.html and add the code.

3. CSS Styling
Open styles.css and add some basic styles to make the app look better.

4. JavaScript Functionality
Open app.js and add the JavaScript to handle the to-do list functionality.

5. Putting It All Together
   
HTML Structure: The HTML provides the structure of the app, including a form to add tasks and an unordered list to display them.
CSS Styling: The CSS makes the app visually appealing by styling the container, form, and list items.
JavaScript Functionality: The JavaScript adds interactivity by allowing users to add new tasks and delete existing ones.

7. Testing the App
Open index.html in a web browser to test your to-do list app. You should be able to add new tasks by typing in the input field and clicking "Add Task". Each task should appear in the list with a "Delete" button that removes the task when clicked.
